** TODO My Top Priority / Highlight today
- The way to do this is to review my Custom Org Agenda + my normal Org Agenda and create a new Agenda specially for today.
- Ideally, I'll pick only one. If I'm feeling ambitious, I'll pick two or three. Pick based on the following:
  - What is truly important? (important for my goals, urgently needs attention)
  - What will give me satisfaction for a job well done? (goal driven)
  - What will give me joy?

** TODO Today's message to myself

** TODO [0/3] The whole day plan for today
- [ ] Review your calendar and plan out your day to the best of your knowledge
- [ ] Create time for tasks that absolutely must be done
- [ ] Create time for your priority task

** TODO Persons I need to lead or connect with today, and how to do it well
